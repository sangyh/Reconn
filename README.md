# Reconn : A python based photo management app using Folium 
This is a fun project I built to manage the photos I used to take for work. As a civil engineer, I would go out to inspect construction sites, and naturally, take lots of photos.
Post-site-visit, I had to make a photo log and document my inspection, but knowing the location of the photos was always a problem. 

So, I began geotagging all photos i captured using my smartphone and then built this simple application which maps the lat-long on a Folium map with marker popups showing the photo-thumbnail.
